    "### 1. value_counts():\n",
    "We can use value_counts() to see what values appear in pounds and how many times each value appears. \n",
    " \n",
    " * By default, the results are sorted with the most frequent value first, so I use sort_index(). To sort them by value instead, with the lightest babies first and heaviest last.    \n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * We can validate the results by comparing them to the codebook, which lists the values and their frequencies. \n",
    "       \n",
    "### 2. describe():\n",
    "Another way to validate data is describe\n",
    "\n",
    "* It compute the summary statistics like the mean, standard deviation, min, and max.\n",

    "            pounds.describe()\n",
    "           \n",

    "   * Now, mean will become 6.70. This is due to removal of 98 and 99 values. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Instead of making a new Series, we can call replace(), with inplace=True. It modifies the existing Series 'in place', that is, without making a copy.\n",
